				Hi there! My name is Kevin Gulledge and I am a current student in the Web Development Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. I graduated from Campbell University in 2002 with a B.A. in Graphic Design. I went back to school to continue my education and change my career to better myself and my family. I am very excited to be attending this course and I look forward to what the future holds after graduation. I am currently a service advisor and have been in this field for the last 14 years this coming November. I am very excited to change my career, however, I do feel that being in the service field has helped me become the person I am and will help me in my future endevors.

				Speaking of family, I have been married to my wife for 9 years this coming August. We have two amazing little boys who are 7 and 3. They keep us on our toes. My hobbies include currently studying to become a coding ninja, getting a nap when I can, and spending as much time as possible with my family.
